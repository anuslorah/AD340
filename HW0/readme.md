Name: Anu Slorah
Preferred name: Anu is fine.
Technology interests: I'm the strongest in front end development but I have dipped into Android development. Right now I am most excited about Python.
Backup plan: If I have trouble with my Dell XPS, I have a desktop that has Android Studio installed. I have a Pixel 3 running Pie for debugging my apps.
